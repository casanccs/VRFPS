Pickable Gun (Make sure FunctionPickup and Pickable collision layer is same layer!!!)
0. Must setup "FunctionPickup" for "Player" scene in each hand
1. In "New Inherited Scene", select the pickable object scene
2. Drag the gun model in and also a collision shape to match the mesh
3. Create 2 instance child scenes in the pickable scene, "grab point hand left and right"
4. Unhide grab point hand scenes and position them to be where you want to hold the gun, then re-hide
5. Then in root node of the scene, extend the script.
6. Add a boolean can_fire variable and set it to true.
7. Create function "action", which is called when player is holding object and pressing trigger
	func action():
		.action()
8. In the function, if can_fire, then call _spawn_bullet(), set can_fire to false
9. Create a pass function of _spawn_bullet()
10. Create cooldown and oneshot
11. Connect cooldown to script.
12. Start timer in action function after shooting
13. Cooldown timer will cause can_fire to true
14. Create a 3d node for "spawn point" and move it in front of the gun barrel.
15. Create a bullet scene with rigidbody with the mesh and collision shape.
16. Create script on bullet scene and add a timer node to the scene.
17. One shot timer and autostart it.
18. Connect the timer to the script to queue_free() it.
19. export PackedScene in the gun scene for the bullet and drag the bullet scene into it.
20. In the _spawn_bullet() function, if you have a bullet scene, spawn new bullet instance
21. If the bullet_inst exists, use bullet_inst.set_as_toplevel(true).
	- Bullet will move independently from the gun as it is a child of the gun
22. add_child(bullet_inst)
23. Set transform of bulllet to be global_transform of the spawn point:
	- bullet_inst.transform = $SpawnPoint.global_transform
24. Set linear_velocity of the bullet:
	- bullet_inst.linear_velocity = bullet_inst.transform.basis.z * bullet_velocity
